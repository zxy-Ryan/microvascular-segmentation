# 2. Setup: Set up the stage for your experimental results.

## 1. Describe the dataset, including its basic statistics

The competition data comprises tiles extracted from five Whole Slide Images (WSI) split into two datasets. Tiles from Dataset 1 have annotations that have been expert reviewed. Dataset 2 comprises the remaining tiles from these same WSIs and contain sparse annotations that have not been expert reviewed.

All of the test set tiles are from Dataset 1.
Two of the WSIs make up the training set, two WSIs make up the public test set, and one WSI makes up the private test set.
The training data includes Dataset 2 tiles from the public test WSI, but not from the private test WSI.

Accuracy
To evaluate the accuracy of the performance, we used 3 types of scores: aAcc, mDice, and mAcc.

"aAcc," "Dice," and "mAcc" are metrics commonly used in fields like medical imaging, computer vision, and particularly in tasks like image segmentation.

aAcc(Average Accuracy) represents the average accuracy across all classes in a classification task. In the context of image segmentation, this would mean calculating the accuracy for each class (i.e., how well the model can identify each specific class in the image) and then averaging these accuracies.

Dice Coefficient (Dice Similarity Coefficient, DSC) is a statistical tool used to gauge the similarity of two samples. In image segmentation, it's often used to measure the similarity between the ground truth segmentation and the segmentation predicted by the model. The formula for the Dice Coefficient is
![Example Image](images/Formula.png)

A Dice Coefficient of 1 indicates perfect agreement between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth, while a coefficient of 0 indicates no overlap.

mAcc (Mean Accuracy) is another metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It's calculated as the average of the class-wise accuracy. In image segmentation, this means computing the accuracy for each segment or class separately and then taking the average of these accuracies. It differs from Average Accuracy in the way it normalizes or weights the accuracy of each class before averaging.

Comparison with other models
We compared our result with others' results on the same dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/code/hidetaketakahashi/hubmap-segmentation-report#7.-Analysis-of-Validation-Result

They used IoU to evaluate their models. They performed UNET and FCN on the dataset and used IoU to evaluate their models. So we calculated the IoU of our DeepLab model for comparison.

Intersection over Union (IoU) is a fundamental metric used in the field of computer vision, particularly in object detection and image segmentation tasks. It quantifies the overlap between two areas, typically between the ground truth and the predicted output of a model. The IoU is calculated by dividing the area of overlap between the predicted and true regions by the area of union of these regions. Essentially, it measures how much the predicted boundary overlaps with the ground truth boundary, with a value of 1 indicating perfect overlap and a value of 0 indicating no overlap at all. This metric is crucial for evaluating the accuracy of models in tasks where precise localization of objects within an image is important.

The comparison is as follows:

4.                           Discussion:
    Strengths
    The model shows high accuracy and Dice scores for 'background' and 'glomerulus' classes, indicating its effectiveness in these areas.
    The performance on the 'blood_vessel' class, though satisfactory, is lower than the other classes. This is because of the nature of the dataset. Blood vessels in different parts of the kidney are not the same. In this dataset, there are tissues samples from the renal cortex, renal medulla and renal papilla. Moreover, The microvasculature structures are different in those three types of tissue.

Comparison with FCN and UNET
The model's Intersection over Union (IoU) score was compared with other models (FCN and UNET) on the same dataset. Your DeepLab model achieved the highest IoU of 0.43, surpassing FCN (0.36) and UNET (0.37). This suggests superior boundary overlap accuracy. There could be the following reasons:

The DeepLab model's superior performance in IoU and other key metrics over FCN and UNET can be attributed to several strategic enhancements. Firstly, the DeepLab model inherently possesses architectural advantages that are conducive to more accurate semantic segmentation. This architecture is designed to efficiently capture multi-scale contextual information, which is crucial in delineating precise object boundaries in complex images.
Additionally, the data preprocessing phase in this research was significantly augmented through extensive data augmentation techniques. By incorporating random scaling, random cropping, random flipping, and photometric distortion, the model was exposed to a more diverse set of training examples. This variety in the training dataset likely contributed to the model's enhanced ability to generalize and accurately segment images under various conditions and orientations, thereby improving its IoU score.
Another pivotal aspect of the model's success is the innovative combination of cross entropy loss and focal loss used as the model's loss function. Cross entropy loss is a standard choice for classification tasks, effectively handling the basic segmentation challenges. However, the integration of focal loss is particularly beneficial in addressing the issue of class imbalance, a common challenge in semantic segmentation tasks. Focal loss places more emphasis on hard-to-classify examples, ensuring that the model does not become biased towards the dominant classes and pays adequate attention to all classes, including those that are underrepresented or more challenging to segment. This balanced approach towards learning is likely a key factor in achieving higher IoU scores, as it ensures more accurate predictions across all classes.

    Areas for Improvement
    Despite the notable success of the DeepLab model in surpassing the IoU metrics of FCN and UNET, there remains room for further enhancement to achieve even greater accuracy and efficiency in semantic segmentation. Key areas for potential improvement include:

Class-Specific Optimization: While the overall performance is commendable, certain classes may still exhibit lower accuracy or Dice scores. Targeted improvements, such as class-specific training strategies or advanced data augmentation techniques tailored for these challenging classes, could enhance the model's precision across all categories.
Computational Efficiency: Although the model achieves high accuracy, the complexity of the DeepLab architecture might impact the computational efficiency, particularly for large-scale or real-time applications. Exploring methods to streamline the model, such as pruning, quantization, or employing more efficient backbone networks, could reduce computational demands while maintaining high accuracy.
Robustness to Varied Inputs: To further improve the model's robustness and adaptability, testing and training on a more diverse set of images, especially those with varying qualities and from different domains, could be beneficial. This could help in assessing and enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.
Loss Function Refinement: While the combination of cross entropy loss and focal loss has shown promising results, continual experimentation with other loss functions or a more refined weighting strategy between these losses could yield even better segmentation outcomes.
Deep Learning Innovations: Staying abreast of the latest advancements in deep learning and integrating novel neural network architectures, regularization techniques, or training methodologies could provide additional performance boosts.

5.                           Conclusion: In several sentences, summarize what you have done in this project.

In this project, I employed the DeepLab model for semantic segmentation of microvessels and glomeruli in images. During data pre-processing, I applied extensive data augmentation techniques, including random scaling, random cropping, random flipping, and photometric distortion, along with data normalization. Throughout the training process, I utilized a custom loss function combining cross-entropy loss and focal loss, and employed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimization algorithm. This approach resulted in the model achieving high accuracy and precision in segmenting the targeted structures, outperforming other models in key metrics such as IoU. This success highlights the effectiveness of the chosen methodologies in handling the complexities of microvascular and glomerular image segmentation.
